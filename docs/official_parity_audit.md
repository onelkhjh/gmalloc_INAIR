This audit separates the published/official behavior from the indoor research
adaptations in this repository.

## Confirmed official behavior

| Stage | Official implementation |
|---|---|
| Cell width | Computes `W = 2 h tan(F/2)`, casts to `int`, then reduces an odd width by one. |
| Cell acceptance | Samples the cell perimeter every 3 m and accepts only a complete expected perimeter inside the AOI polygon. |
| Partitioning | Uses `MiniBatchKMeans`, `n_clusters=node_count`, tolerance `cell_size/8`, maximum 10 iterations. |
| Cluster/node association | Greedily associates each cluster with a remaining robot start using the nearest cluster cell. |
| Conflict detection | A cell is conflicting when its sampled boundary contains more than one cluster label. |
| Conflict bid | Fixes `distance_bias = round(d0 / cell_size) * B` before auction; default `B=0.5`. It then minimizes `current_cell_count + distance_bias`. |
| Tie behavior | Comparison uses strict `<`; the first candidate remains winner on equal cost. |
| Default CPP | Repeated Euclidean nearest neighbor over cell centres. The public `nn` branch requests brute-force neighbors despite other branches using KD-tree. |
| Route closure | Adds the robot start at the beginning and end of every path. |

## Corrections applied

- Conflict distance bias is now calculated once, normalized in cell widths,
  rounded, and multiplied by `B`.
- Conflict bids now reuse that fixed bias while the assigned cell count changes.
- Coverage path distance and visualization now include return to the node start.
- Exact ties remain resolved by stable candidate order.

## Deliberate indoor adaptations

- Input coordinates are local Cartesian metres; geographic conversion is out of
  scope.
- Floating-point cell width is retained. Official integer/even rounding would
  reduce the current `0.924 m` indoor footprint to zero and is not usable at
  laboratory scale.
- `any_overlap` is available to cover the complete AOI. Official code behaves
  more like a fully-contained perimeter policy.
- Perimeter spacing defaults to `W/8`; official code fixes it at 3 m, which is
  larger than the entire indoor cell.
- The local nearest-neighbor implementation uses a KD-tree as described by the
  paper; the official default code currently selects brute force.
- Consecutive coverage targets are expanded into valid-cell 4-neighbor A*
  transit paths. This is an indoor execution constraint after the paper's visit
  ordering stage.

These adaptations must be reported in indoor experiment results and must not be
presented as byte-for-byte official-code reproduction.

## Implemented official clustering profile

The `official_minibatch` profile now uses `MiniBatchKMeans`, at most 10
iterations, `W/8` tolerance, and the public code's greedy cluster-to-node
association. A random seed is explicitly recorded for reproducibility. The
original implementation remains available as the non-default
`deterministic_lloyd` legacy/test profile. It is excluded from official
comparison and KPI artifacts.

Exact historical parity with the scikit-learn version used by the public code
is not guaranteed. The profile explicitly sets the older defaults
`batch_size=100` and `n_init=3`; comparisons must report the profile, seed, and
installed library version.
